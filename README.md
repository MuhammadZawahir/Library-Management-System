# Library-Management-System
This is a library management system created by using C++ which I made for my semester project.
This is my first C++ project.
This aims at providing the user interactive and easy to use LMS in which the user can borrow a book, return it and even add new books.
This LMS will keep track of the books that you have borrowed and updates their availability status if they are borrowed or returned.
I have used the header file 'ctime' to calculate fine for late returning of the book.
Future changes can include interactive displays and more options for librarians and users.
